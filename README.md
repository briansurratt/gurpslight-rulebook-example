# gurpslight-rulebook-example
A partial implementation of the GURPS Light rules using the Rulesbook framework as a learning exercise and example

* [GURPS light rules](http://www.sjgames.com/gurps/lite/)
* [Rulebook java library](https://github.com/rulebook-rules/rulebook)

The intent of this project is to 
* explore the Rulebook library
* get practice developing tests which do not tightly bind the test to the implementation.
    * Tests will be implements using a standard Java implementation
    * Another implementation which satisfies the test using Rulebook
